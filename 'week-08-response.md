  When using and consuming media on the internet we are liable and are exposed to being targeted with different methods used by institutions such as for- profit colleges. One method used to target specific individuals is called lead generation. O'Neal discusses how for-profit colleges exploits those that are in desperate need of a job or coupons by creating fake job openings that take an individuals information to later try and sell them the idea of a possible better life with education. In relation I myself have encountered many job openings that have turned out to be fake and have only been a way to record my personal information.

  Even though it might seem like these methods of targeted ads are customized towards an users interest it might not necessarily be a good thing. These patterns on things searched and clicked on are only used for the purpose of selling something. I think when these algorithms were created what the creator mainly had in mind was to maximize the profits and not learn the interests of a user and cater their experience towards their liking. Without these methods the internet would definitively be more useful and egalitarian. Not having to worry about misleading ads that might want to be selling you something you don't know about would be more useful and taking away the targeting of only certain individuals would make things fair.
